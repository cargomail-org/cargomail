## Introduction

Cargomail uses the Global Reference Identity Protocol (GRIP) for email authentication instead of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication method. GRIP employs [identity propagation and assertion apparatus](https://github.com/cargomail-org/grip) to convey identity information about the end user across different administrative authorities of the email services.
