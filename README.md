# Email

Email is the most pervasive form of business information exchange. People use email as an interpersonal communication tool and as the default choice to send files. Over time, your inbox becomes a personal knowledge repository of what was sent by whom and when. Such an email repository has one fundamental flaw. Due to the design principle of the email system, the email cannot contain large attachments. Thus, users often send links to external files instead of attachments or inline images. Links may expire with time, or external files may change. Consequently, your knowledge repository gradually deteriorates.

# Cargomail

Cargomail does not use attachments or links to external files. Instead, it uses an advanced web editor, which allows users to define documents, images, and videos in the message body by their content, keeping the respective data in a content-addressable mailbox.
